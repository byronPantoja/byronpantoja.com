This is the repo to my website where I want to just document my digital journey as tech enthusiast. I don't want to call my self a full-stack developer, but that is one of my goals -- plan, design, build, test, deploy, iterate.

I'm currently working to help friends and family find effective long term digital business solutions.

So when I talk with other developers and they ask me "What's your stack?", I really don't know how to answer. Yes I studied JavaScript and I'm still learning it -- but from there I choose my stack based on the requirements, how the budget is defined, and whether or not I will be maintaining this solution.

I like learning to code and hope to one day be able to tinker with gadgets and hardware -- something I think would be fun to do with my daughters.

Anyways, that's me.

This repo was cloned from Tim Lin's [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). I learned a lot from this repository, definitely worth checking it out!
