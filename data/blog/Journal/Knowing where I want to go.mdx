9 years ago, after listening to [Sal's Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare), I decided to push the reset button on my math education. My goal was to conquer my fear of algebra, and the only way I could do that was by building a good foundation. My foundation was built on clever tactics, and not mathematics. I decided if I was going to do this for me, then I'll start at K1.I racked up 773652 points on Khan Academy as I moved through all the grades until I got to Algebra — and I loved it.

> I fell in-love with math.

I didn't become a math genius, but I learned to appreciate the language of mathematics. This was a turning point in my life, it allowed me to think differently about finances, inventory, and pricing (I was managing our cafe at the time).

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">

  </div>
</div>

I think I need to _push the reset button_ on learning to code. I've done this few times, but I never bothered to assess what I've learned. It was always easier to assume I learned nothing and move on to a new zero to mastery style tutorial. But recently, as I've gone down a deep rabbit hole in search of a way to be more productive and organized, I found the [Red Gregory](https://www.redgregory.com/). There I learned to optimize my workspace and _organize my life._

Red Gregory's [PARA Inspired](https://www.redgregory.com/notion/2021/8/5/free-comprehensive-second-brain-notion-template) Template is the system I've been looking for ([THE P.A.R.A METHOD](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) is the system, but this template's implementation of it is what **_I've_** been searching for). It has allowed to begin organizing my bookmarks of random interests into areas, projects, and resources that make sense. I learned to create a second brain.

And because of that, I was able to start thinking about where I'm at and where I want to go.

### Where am I at? What do I know?

Instead of boring you with a bulleted list of technologies I've come across and/or played with, I'll just talk it out here instead of touring you through my second brain.

I know **HTML and CSS**. I can confidently build pages in it, but would have more fun using Tailwind. I'm no wizard here, but with the tools available today and my solid understanding of the fundamentals, I'm confident I could learn to build pixel perfect layouts.

**Javascript** is where I have difficulty assessing what I know, there's a lot. But I've done the fundamentals, enough times that I can build basic websites like blogs, eCommerce with storefronts, landing pages — in any framework by looking at the docs, examples, or tutorials (and when I'm in a pinch bugging support!). But I lack a solid understanding of Algorithms and Data structures.

**Data**, what do I know? I've built a few basic MERN applications. I did a nextJS tutorial that used firebase. I use SQL to migrate WordPress sites from local to the server. I've played with headless WordPress sites using Apollo/GraphQL. I've played with a few things in python and Django/ReactJS/mySQL. And I've played with Jupiter Notebooks when I was learning about machine learning and data science. Connecting to a Database and creating schemas is something I know I can learn to do. Where I get stuck is understanding why one is chosen over another.

This search eventually led me to [Qcon Plus by InfoQ](https://www.youtube.com/user/MarakanaTechTV), which led me to micro services. After watching a few videos, I realized this is what I want know more about — I want to know how Netflix and YouTube are built.

### Where am I going? What do I need to know?

Here's what I think I need to focus on so that I can begin working in the industry:

1. UI/UX Design — Skill set is there, it's a small pivot to a nice to have for my portfolio
2. Algorithms and DataStructures — To build a solid programming foundations and to prepare for interviews.
3. Vanilla JavaScript / Microfrontends — Build small projects and write about them to showcase understanding and build an online presence/portfolio
4. Typescript — To build robust programs and contribute to open source
5. Micro Services / Cloud Architecture — To learn how to leverage data and technology like large corporations
6. Write a blog every week. They'll get better.
