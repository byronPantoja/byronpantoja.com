The photo above illustrates the way my mind tries to understand things I'm interested in. I want to pull it all apart and learn how it works, what it does, why it is the way it is. After a decade of interest and four solid years of digging into technologies, I finally feel ready to focus on fewer technologies and build my portfolio using the skills I've learned.

But be honest, I'm not 100% sure yet whether I want to build a career or a business, but either way, I know I have a lot to learn. **This blog is a milestone on my journey into code.** Finding this combination of iA writer to Github was monumental, I can't tell you how many CMS option I went through -- **name a CMS that was free and I bet you I tried it.** But Now it's here, it works, and I love it. Welcome to my blog!

This is where I want to communicate what I'm working on with others, share what I'm learning, what I've learned, and where I'm kinda stuck. My goal here is to be a better writer, document my progress to better evaluate my productivity, and bring something of value to those who are on a similar journey.

## The Long Road

The first time I was introduced to building websites was in the early 2000s, but it wasn't until a drunken conversation in an upscale Jazz bar in 2008, Shanghai, that a seed was planted in my brain. My cousin had introduced me to his friend -- a serial entrepreneur from Vancouver who owned a digital agency for fun. I talked to him about being a self-taught web developer who built websites for SMEs in the Philippines. _But the truth was I built one website. It was for my aunt. And I didn't charge, I asked her to pay for the used laptop that I'd use to build the site._ Short into the conversation he cuts me off and says,

> Got it, got it. Hey, let me help you out. Learn HTML and CSS on w3schools.com, pass the certification exams there, then send me an email. Starting salary is 50 to 60k a year.

I never followed up with the offer, I was committed to learning the craft of commercial photography at the time. But my takeaway from that opportunity was w3schools. I studied HTML and CSS on that site and passed the practice exams, but never bothered to take the next step to become certified.

### Master of all === Master of None

When I finally took the next step forward into coding in 2018, it was scary. I felt like there was a new course that _every developer needed to learn or be left behind_ every week! My anxiety was through the roof and I'd drop a course to learn another on regular basis. The same feeling came over me when I began choosing hosting platforms, domains, storefronts, databases, cloud services, and all that. There's an unbelievable amount to learn. **But after a while, I began to realize that it's a lot of the same thing.** Technologies will change, new platforms will pop up, but if you understand the fundamentals you can pick it up and learn as you go.

I'm at a point now where I'm not stuck, like if I want to use technology to build this blog or an eCommerce store -- I can. But I do understand the fundamental difference between being able to use a tool vs being able to repair it. I can't repair every tool I use on my own, but I do understand how to troubleshoot the problem using online resources.

In addition to online resources, I've reached out to a mentor who is willing to guide me and help me with any blockers I run into -- she's awesome!

It's been a long journey for me to get here, and "here", isn't really anywhere. I still have a lot to prove in the coming months.

Talk soon.
